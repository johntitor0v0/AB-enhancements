# AnimeBytes Enhancements

I recommend [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) for managing userscripts.

## AB Autofill Printed Media Details

A userscript that autofills printed media details from Bookwalker and Anilist on [AnimeBytes](https://animebytes.tv/).

### Features
- Autofill details from Bookwalker using the product link or by searching for the title
- Autofill details from Anilist using the manga/LN link or by searching for the title

### Usage
1. On the upload page, switch to the desired tab (light novels or manga).
2. In the autofill section, paste the product link from Bookwalker into the input field and click the "Autofill!" button. 
Alternatively, you can enter an Anilist manga/LN link or type in a title to search, then click the "Autofill!" button.
3. The autofill form should be filled with the information from the source.

## AB Torrent Releases Filtering

The [AB Mediainfo Improvements](https://animebytes.tv/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=27557) userscript is needed for this to work.

### Features
 - Filters out torrents based on the source, container, codec, resolution, audio codec, audio channels, and whether it has Japanese subtitles.
 - Alt + click to select only one option.
 - Filter options include manual fields such as file format and completion status.
